# Triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane

This repository contains C++ programs that implement algorithms for the paper A.A. Gaifullin, "634 vertex-transitive and more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane", arXiv???

This README file contains only technical information on the realizations of the algorithms. For the goals and descriptions of the algorithms, see the quoted paper.
